# Type Classes

## Chapter Goals

This chapter will introduce a powerful form of abstraction which is enabled by PureScript's type system - type classes.

This motivating example for this chapter will be a library for hashing data structures. We will see how the machinery of type classes allow us to hash complex data structures without having to think directly about the structure of the data itself.

We will also see a collection of standard type classes from PureScript's Prelude and standard libraries. PureScript code leans heavily on the power of type classes to express ideas concisely, so it will be beneficial to familiarise yourself with these classes.

## Show Me!

Our first simple example of a type class is provided by a function we've seen several times already: the `show` function, which takes a value and displays it as a string.

`show` is defined by a type class in the `Prelude` module called `Show`, which is defined as follows:

```
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String
```
