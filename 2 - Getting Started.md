# Getting Started

## Chapter Goals

In this first chapter, the goal will be to set up a working PureScript development environment, and to write our first PureScript program.

The first program we will write is a phone book appliction. It will be the motivation for learning how to work with functions and types in PureScript.

## Introduction

Here are the tools we will be using to set up our PureScript development environment:

- `psc` ([http://purescript.org](purescript.org)) - The PureScript compiler itself.
- `npm` ([http://npmjs.org](npmjs.org))- The Node Package Manager, which will allow us to install the rest of our development tools.
- `bower` ([http://bower.io/](bower.io)) - A package manager which is used to version various PureScript packages which we will need.
- `grunt` ([http://gruntjs.com/](gruntjs.com)) - An automation tool which we will use to build our PureScript code.

The first half of the chapter will guide you through installing and configuring these tools. In the second half, we will work on writing some actual code.

## Installing PureScript

The PureScript compiler can be downloaded as a binary distribution for Windows, MacOS or Linux from [http://purescript.org](purescript.org).
